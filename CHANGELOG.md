First release! __This is a preview release not ready to be used seriously__.

## Features

## Known Issues

- __(critical)__ staying open a couple of minutes (even idling) leads to memory hog, high cpu usage and quickly browser tab crash
- many javascript errors outputted by ipfs in the browser console
- when a directory is loaded, the app starts analyzing its items to figure out their size, if they are a folder and other information. At the moment this process locks the browser when the folder is too big.
- downloads don't work on firefox (missing Streams API)
- no tests
- not yet optimized or polished visually
